# Contributing

All contributions are welcome!

### How to contribute

Create a GitHub issue or a pull request with your change.

If you just want to add a new message, you can create an issue and I will add it for you as soon as possible.

But I encourage you to create a pull request with your message, it's a good way to learn how to contribute to open source projects, learn a little bit about Git, GitHub, Javascript and web development.

### Setting up the project

See the [Dev Setup](/docs/dev-setup.md) guide for more information.

### Adding a new message

To add a new message, you need to edit the `src/messages.ts` file.

Add a new object to the `messages` array following the structure defined there.

All fields are required and can receive functions, so you should be able to create messages with dynamic content or specify custom conditions.

All messages are currently in Portuguese, but you can add messages in other languages if you want.
